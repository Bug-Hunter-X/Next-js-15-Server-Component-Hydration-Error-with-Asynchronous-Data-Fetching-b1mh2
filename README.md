# Next.js 15 Server Component Hydration Error

This repository demonstrates an uncommon error in Next.js 15 related to asynchronous data fetching within server components. The error occurs when a server component attempts to render before the asynchronous data fetch operation completes. This results in a hydration mismatch and can lead to unexpected behavior or errors.

## Problem
Server components rely on the edge runtime.  Asynchronous operations, such as `fetch`, must be properly handled to avoid the component rendering before the data is ready.

## Solution
The solution involves using asynchronous rendering techniques to ensure the data is available before the component is rendered.  This might involve using `Suspense` to handle loading states, or restructuring the component to ensure that the rendering depends on the availability of the data.

## Setup
1. Clone this repository
2. Run `npm install`
3. Run `npm run dev`
