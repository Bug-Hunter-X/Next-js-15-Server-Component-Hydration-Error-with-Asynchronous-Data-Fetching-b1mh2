In Next.js 15, an uncommon error arises when using server components with edge runtime and incorrect data fetching.  For example, if you attempt to fetch data within a server component using `fetch` and try to directly use that data in the component's return, you might encounter unexpected behavior or errors during hydration. This happens because the data fetching is asynchronous, and the server component might render before the data is available.  Here's a code example:

```javascript
// pages/index.js (server component)
export default async function Home() {
  const res = await fetch('https://api.example.com/data');
  const data = await res.json();
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>{data.title}</h1>
    </div>
  );
}
```
This will likely fail during hydration.
